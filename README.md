# GuessingTheWord
Guessing Game in Java where players try to guess a hidden word by entering letters. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and displays it as underscores. Each correct guess reveals the letter in its position, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of attempts, which are set as the word length plus three.
